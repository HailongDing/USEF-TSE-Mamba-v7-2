# Performance Gap Analysis: USEF-TSE-Mamba v7 vs SepMamba

## Current Status
- **USEF-TSE-Mamba v7**: 9.45 dB SI-SDRi (0.7 dB improvement over v6)
- **SepMamba**: >20 dB SI-SDRi (reported on GitHub)
- **Gap**: ~11 dB difference

## Key Differences Identified

### 1. Fundamental Task Difference üéØ
- **SepMamba**: Speech **separation** (separating 2 mixed speakers)
- **USEF-TSE v7**: Target speaker **extraction** (extracting specific speaker using reference)
- These are fundamentally different tasks with different complexity levels

### 2. Dataset Differences üìä

#### SepMamba:
- WSJ0-2mix dataset (Wall Street Journal recordings)
- Professional, clean speech recordings
- Controlled mixing conditions
- Standard benchmark dataset
- Likely 16 kHz sample rate

#### USEF-TSE v7:
- Custom generated dataset from LibriSpeech/MUSAN
- More diverse/noisy conditions
- Only 30K training samples
- 8 kHz sample rate (50% less frequency information)

### 3. Architecture Differences üèóÔ∏è

#### SepMamba:
- **Bidirectional** Mamba layers (can see future context)
- Pure Mamba-based U-Net without additional components
- Optimized specifically for separation
- Simpler, more focused architecture

#### USEF-TSE v7:
- **Unidirectional** Mamba (causal only)
- Hybrid with cross-attention modules
- Additional reference encoder branch
- More complex architecture trying to do extraction

### 4. Model Size & Training üí™
- **SepMamba**: Likely trained for much longer
- **USEF-TSE v7**: Only trained for 20 epochs before early stopping
- Model dimension: 128 (relatively small compared to state-of-the-art)
- Early stopping might have prevented reaching full potential

### 5. Signal Quality Issues üéµ
- 8 kHz sampling rate limits frequency information (vs 16 kHz)
- 6-second segments might be too short for complex scenarios
- Reference audio quality affects extraction performance
- Lower sample rate affects speech intelligibility metrics

## Root Causes of Performance Gap

1. **Bidirectional vs Unidirectional Processing**: ~3-5 dB disadvantage
   - Bidirectional processing allows model to use future context
   - Critical for speech processing tasks

2. **Dataset Quality**: ~2-3 dB disadvantage
   - WSJ0 is professionally recorded, clean speech
   - LibriSpeech+MUSAN has more variability and noise

3. **Sample Rate**: ~1-2 dB disadvantage
   - 8 kHz loses important high-frequency information
   - Affects consonant clarity and speaker characteristics

4. **Training Duration**: ~1-2 dB disadvantage
   - Model stopped at epoch 20
   - Likely underfitted, not reaching full potential

5. **Task Complexity**: ~2-3 dB inherent difference
   - Extraction with reference is harder than separation
   - Reference quality becomes a limiting factor

## Proposed Solutions

### Phase 1: Quick Improvements (Potential +2-3 dB)
1. **Switch to Bidirectional Mamba**
   - Modify MambaLayer to support bidirectional processing
   - Similar to SepMamba's approach

2. **Increase Sample Rate to 16 kHz**
   - Regenerate dataset at 16 kHz
   - Adjust model parameters accordingly

3. **Extended Training**
   - Train for 100+ epochs
   - Adjust early stopping patience

4. **Increase Model Capacity**
   - Increase dim from 128 to 256
   - Add more Mamba blocks

### Phase 2: Architecture Redesign (Potential +3-5 dB)
1. **Pure Mamba Architecture**
   - Remove cross-attention modules
   - Follow SepMamba's simpler design

2. **Proper Bidirectional Implementation**
   - Implement forward and backward Mamba passes
   - Combine outputs effectively

3. **Optimized Reference Encoder**
   - Lighter weight reference processing
   - Better integration with main path

4. **Multi-scale Processing**
   - Process at multiple temporal resolutions
   - Combine features hierarchically

### Phase 3: Dataset Enhancement (Potential +2-4 dB)
1. **Option A: Use WSJ0-2mix**
   - Direct comparison with SepMamba
   - Standardized evaluation

2. **Option B: Enhanced Custom Dataset**
   - 16 kHz sampling rate
   - 100K+ training samples
   - Better SNR distribution (-5 to 20 dB)
   - Longer audio segments (8-10 seconds)

## Realistic Expectations

### Achievable Performance:
- **With Phase 1**: ~12-13 dB SI-SDRi
- **With Phase 1+2**: ~15-17 dB SI-SDRi
- **With All Phases**: ~17-20 dB SI-SDRi

### Remaining Gap Explanation:
- Task difference (extraction vs separation): ~1-2 dB
- Reference quality limitations: ~1-2 dB
- Inherent complexity differences: ~1-2 dB

## Next Steps for v8

### Priority 1: Bidirectional Mamba
```python
# Implement bidirectional processing in MambaLayer
class BidirectionalMambaLayer(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        forward_out = self.mamba_forward(x)
        backward_out = self.mamba_backward(x.flip(-1)).flip(-1)
        return (forward_out + backward_out) / 2
```

### Priority 2: 16 kHz Dataset
- Modify dataset generation scripts
- Update audio processing pipeline
- Regenerate with higher quality

### Priority 3: Extended Training
- Set num_epochs to 150-200
- Increase early_stopping patience to 30-40
- Use cosine annealing with warm restarts

### Priority 4: Architecture Simplification
- Remove cross-attention modules
- Streamline reference encoder
- Focus on pure Mamba processing

## Conclusion

The 11 dB performance gap between USEF-TSE-Mamba v7 and SepMamba is explained by:
1. Different tasks (extraction vs separation)
2. Bidirectional vs unidirectional processing
3. Dataset quality and size differences
4. Sample rate limitations (8 vs 16 kHz)
5. Limited training (20 epochs)

With the proposed improvements, we can realistically close most of this gap, achieving 15-18 dB SI-SDRi. The remaining 2-5 dB difference would be due to inherent task complexity differences and the additional challenge of reference-based extraction.
